              Growing up, storytelling was woven into the fabric of my life. My father had a talent for spinning amusing tales (and very, very, very bad jokes), and my grandfather, a proud Glaswegian, was the epitome of a ‚Äúpatter merchant‚Äù‚Äîcharming and quick-witted, always ready with a story to captivate his audience. (Once, between the two of them, they tried to convince my siblings and me that a haggis was a three-legged creature that lived in Scotland, its fur used to make kilts, and its body to make a bagpipe.)

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Those influences shaped how I view the world (and continued with my own son, much to his head-shaking at how lame a parent he has (teens, huh?)): as a series of adventures, challenges, and opportunities to tell a tale.

                  It‚Äôs no wonder, then, that I‚Äôve turned my portfolio into <strong>The Adventure Begins: A Portfolio Story</strong>. This isn‚Äôt just a standard list of projects or a plain resume‚Äîit‚Äôs an immersive journey into my creative and technical skills, told in a way that reflects who I am.

                  Why did I choose this approach? Because storytelling is one of the most powerful tools we have to connect with others, and in a competitive industry, standing out matters. Turning my skills into a story not only showcases my work‚Äîit engages, inspires, and leaves a lasting impression.
